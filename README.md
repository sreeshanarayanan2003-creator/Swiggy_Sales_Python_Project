# Swiggy_Sales_Python_Project
Python based Swiggy sales data analysis with interactive and static visualizations using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

*🍔Swiggy Sales Analysis (Python)*

 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy sales data using Python to uncover insights related to sales trends, order distribution, and overall performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to support data-driven decision making.

 Objectives

1.Analyze Swiggy sales data to identify key trends

2.Understand order patterns and sales distribution

3.Visualize insights using static and interactive charts

Tools & Technologies Used

a)Python

b)Pandas – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

c)Matplotlib – Basic static visualizations

d)Seaborn – Advanced statistical visualizations

e)Plotly – Interactive and dynamic visualizations

 Use of Plotly

Plotly was used to create interactive visualizations that allow users to:

Explore sales trends dynamically
View detailed insights using hover tooltips
Zoom and interact with charts for better understanding
This improves insight discovery compared to static charts.

 Results & Insights

Identified key sales trends and patterns
Visualized data for easy interpretation
Gained actionable insights from Swiggy sales data

 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical use of Python for data analysis and effective visualization techniques to derive meaningful business insights from sales data.
